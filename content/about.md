Hello, my name is **Manuel**.

I'm a **Software Developer** and **Open Source** enthusiast with a broad background in Fullstack-Development and a passion for Observability, currently living in **Calgary, Canada**.

This blog is the place were I put into words a portion of my knowledge, synthesizing my personal discovery's and learning's but with no ambition of being the absolute source of truth to anything. I hope you find here something that can help you as it helped me before ðŸ˜Š

You can also find me at [Github](https://github.com/mschoenlaub).
